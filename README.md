<p align="center">Turns Minecraft into a 2D side-scroller.</p>

# Description

Sometimes living in all three dimensions can be a real stressor, so why not take a load off and live in two instead?

**Two Dimensional: Reloaded** transforms Minecraft into a 2D side-scroller by removing access to the third dimension and restricting player movement to a single plane along the X axis.

If you ever start to miss your three-dimensional life, just press **B** to access the background layer.

Based on the original mod [**Two Dimensional**](https://modrinth.com/mod/two-dimensional) by Mishkis.

## Usage
Hold **B** to turn around, allowing you to place and break blocks on the background layer. (keybind configurable under **Two Dimensional: Reloaded → Face Away**).

If you feel like the camera viewport size is too small, increase your FOV to see farther out.

Build a Nether portal in the background layer and right click a portal block to travel to the Nether (vanilla cooldowns and timing apply).

Optional Block Placement Guide Feature (Use Cloth Config API + ModMenu to configure)

## Notes
- The current build is in very early alpha, you will experience bugs, please feel free to add to the issue tracker.
- *Now with Iris Shaders support!*  I've done most of the development with Photon Shaders enabled, but you can bring whatever pack you'd like :)
- **Sodium & Cloth Config API are currently required**. Making Sodium optional may be explored in the future, but maintaining both vanilla and Sodium-compatible versions increases development complexity.
